# Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project predicts whether a user will click on an online advertisement using machine learning models.  
It is a classification problem where the target variable is **`Clicked on Ad`** (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Understand user behavior towards online advertisements.
- Compare different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- Help advertisers target the right audience and optimize ad spending.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains **10,000 records** with the following features:
- **Daily Time Spent on Site** â†’ Time spent by user (minutes).  
- **Age** â†’ Userâ€™s age.  
- **Area Income** â†’ Average income of the userâ€™s region.  
- **Daily Internet Usage** â†’ Time spent online daily.  
- **Ad Topic Line** â†’ Advertisement text.  
- **City, Country, Gender** â†’ Demographics.  
- **Clicked on Ad** â†’ Target (0 or 1).  

ðŸ‘‰ Dataset file: `ad_10000records.csv`

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing  
   - Handle categorical variables (Gender, City, Country).  
   - Feature selection for model training.  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Correlation heatmaps.  
   - Trends between age, internet usage, and ad clicks.  

3. Model Training  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Random Forest Classifier  

4. Evaluation  
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)  
   - Confusion Matrix  

---

## ðŸš€ Results
- Logistic Regression â†’ ~90% accuracy  
- Decision Tree â†’ ~94% accuracy  
- Random Forest â†’ ~96% accuracy (Best Model âœ…)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Future Work
- Add more features (time of day, device type, etc.).  
- Deploy model as a **Flask / Django web app**.  
- Create an **interactive dashboard** with Streamlit or Power BI.  
- Try deep learning (ANNs).
